### DIAGNOSIS:
The strategy is underperforming primarily due to a low win rate and profit factor, indicating that while some trades are profitable, they are not sufficient to cover losses effectively. The average risk-to-reward ratio is also too low, which is affecting overall profitability. Additionally, the strategy appears to be taking trades in less favorable market conditions, resulting in a higher drawdown and suboptimal entry quality.

### ROOT CAUSES:
1. **Entry Quality**: The current filters may be too strict or misaligned with market conditions, leading to missed high-quality setups or the acceptance of poor setups.
2. **Stop Loss Placement**: The stop losses may be too tight or not appropriately placed relative to key levels, leading to frequent stop-outs.
3. **Take Profit Placement**: Take profit levels may not align with market structure, resulting in a lower average risk-to-reward ratio than targeted.

### SUGGESTIONS:
#### Entry Quality Improvements:
FILE:.env  
SET:EXEC_FILTER_MIN_CONFLUENCE_SCORE  
TO:5  
REASON: Lowering the minimum confluence score will allow for more trades to be generated by the strategy, potentially increasing the number of successful setups while still focusing on quality. This change can help improve the win rate.

#### Stop Loss Adjustment:
FILE:.env  
SET:SL_POI_BUFFER  
TO:0.0075  
REASON: Increasing the stop loss buffer will provide more room for price fluctuations and reduce the likelihood of being stopped out during normal volatility, potentially improving the win rate.

#### Take Profit and R:R Improvement:
FILE:.env  
SET:TP_R_MULT  
TO:2.5  
REASON: Adjusting the take profit multiplier to 2.5 instead of 3.0 will make it more achievable in the current market conditions while still aiming for a favorable risk-to-reward ratio. This change can help in improving average R:R and overall profit factor.

#### Risk Management:
FILE:.env  
SET:maxTradesPerDay  
TO:15  
REASON: Reducing the maximum number of trades per day can help to focus on high-quality setups rather than quantity, which can improve overall win rates and reduce stress on capital over short periods.

#### Market Condition Handling:
FILE:.env  
SET:SMC_AVOID_HTF_SIDEWAYS  
TO:true  
REASON: Enforcing this setting will prevent the strategy from taking trades during sideways market conditions, which typically yield lower win rates and higher drawdowns. This should help in filtering out unfavorable conditions.

By implementing these targeted changes, the strategy can improve its entry quality, manage risk more effectively, and enhance profitability with a more favorable win rate and profit factor.
